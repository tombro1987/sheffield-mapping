=================

Mapping continuous and categorical data in Sheffield. Code for joining and plotting the data were taken from Nick Bearman's course 'Using R for Geodemographic analysis' (https://rpubs.com/nickbearman/r-geodemographics). Thanks also go to Phil Jones for his help with the code, and uploading it using Git Bash.

The first section of code maps households in Sheffield that have no cars/vans at the lower super output area level (LSOA) - this involved updating the mapping code from Nick Bearman's course to include 'breaks' for the continuous data. The Second section of the code updates the OAC classification map from Nick Bearman's course, to the 2011 version (output area level).
