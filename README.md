Mapping continuous andcategorical data in Sheffield. Code for joining and plotting the data were taken from Nick Bearman's course 'Using R for Geodemographic analysis' (https://rpubs.com/nickbearman/r-geodemographics). Thanks also go to Phil Jones for his help with the code. 

The first section of code maps hosueholds in Sheffield that have no car/van availability - this involved updating the code to include 'breaks' for the continuous data. The Second section of the code updates the OAC classification map from Nick Bearman's course, to the 2011 version.
